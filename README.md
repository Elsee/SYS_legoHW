# Azimuth movement
## Description
I solved the problem of straight line following robot using gyro sensor. To solve this problem the initial value of gyro was remembered, and robot direction was stabilized using difference between that initial value and current value.
I think that the results are the best as with the change of them different excessive oscilations and rotations appears.
